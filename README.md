# load-test

A tiny AWS CloudFormation stack to perform basic load testing using Gatling.

## Usage

Go to the AWS CloudFormation console, click "Create Stack", and upload the .yaml file.

Alternatively, use the AWS CLI "create-stack" command.

Alternatively, run the shell script (edit if needed). You still need AWS CLI installed and configured.
