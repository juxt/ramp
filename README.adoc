# ramp - Ramping load test

A shell script wrapper around https://gatling.io/[Gatling] to perform load tests, either locally or remotely using AWS.

It will simulate a number of users who (with ramp-up) attempt to send a GET request every second to a certain URL. It will upload detailed test results to an AWS S3 bucket of your choice where they can be viewed as a web page.

It can be customised for more complex use cases.

## How to use

. If you want to run your simulation remotely or upload the results to an S3 bucket, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html[install] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html[configure] the Amazon Command Line Interface. You may need to set your default region as eu-west-1.

. Call the `run-simulation.sh` script with any arguments you need.

    $ ./run-simulation -b my-bucket-name -p -s -v --TargetUrl http://www.example.com

## Arguments

The list of valid arguments is shown on `./run-simulation.sh -h` All arguments are optional.

Single-dash arguments are used by the script itself. Double-dash arguments are passed to the simulation. The default `LoadSimulation.scala` takes three arguments:

* TargetUrl - the URL you want to load-test.

* PeakUsers - the maximum number of concurrent users to simulate.

* Duration - the total duration of the test in seconds (1/3 ramp-up, 1/3 peak, 1/3 ramp-down).

The script will first look for simulation arguments in `params.txt`, but will overwrite them with your double-dash arguments (if you provide any). You can edit that file manually, which might be useful if you need a *lot* of simulation arguments.

If you use a custom simulation file, you can use custom simulation arguments too. `run-simulation.sh` will accept and pass on arbitrary double-dash arguments. See `Params` in `LoadSimulation.scala` for the syntax to import arguments.

If running locally, you can still specify a bucket name with `-b`. Your results will be uploaded there. For ease of viewing, it is recommended that you make that bucket public with `-p`.

If running remotely, be aware that by default the stack will not be deleted after the simulation is complete (*and you will continue to be billed for its EC2 instance*). This allows you to run multiple simulations in a row without having to create a new stack every time. When you want to delete the stack, use `-s`.

## Customisation

* By default, the script merely sends GET requests to a target url. But it can provide much more complex use cases if you replace `LoadSimulation.scala` with your own https://gatling.io/documentation/[Gatling simulation script].

** Currently, you have to use the same structure: name the file `LoadSimulation.scala`, the package `ramp`, and the Simulation class `LoadSimulation`.

* Currently, the stack can only be created in eu-west-1. If you want to use a different region, you'll have to edit `aws-cft-ramp.yaml` to change the AMI to an Amazon Linux AMI that's valid in the new region. You'll also have to change the `Region` variable at the top of `run-simulation.sh`
